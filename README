NAME
    Convert::UU, uuencode, uudecode - Perl module for uuencode and uudecode

SYNOPSIS
      use Convert::UU qw(uudecode uuencode);
      $encoded_string = uuencode($string,[$filename],[$mode]);
      ($string,$filename,$mode) = uudecode($string);
      $string = uudecode($string); # in scalar context

DESCRIPTION
    * uuencode
        uuencode() takes as the first argument a string that is to be
        uuencoded. Note, that it is the string that is encoded, not a
        filename. Alternatively a filehandle may be passed that must be
        opened for reading. It returns the uuencoded string including
        "begin" and "end". Second and third argument are optional and
        specify filename and mode. If unspecified these default to
        "uuencode.uu" and 644.

    * uudecode
        uudecode() takes a string as argument which will be uudecoded. If
        the argument is a filehandle this handle will be read instead. If it
        is a reference to an ARRAY, the elements are treated like lines that
        form a string. Leading and trailing garbage will be ignored. The
        function returns the uudecoded string for the first begin/end pair.
        In array context it returns an array whose first element is the
        uudecoded string, the second is the filename and the third is the
        mode.

EXPORT
    Both uudecode and uuencode are in @EXPORT_OK.
