NAME
    Convert::UU, uuencode, uudecode - Perl module for uuencode and
    uudecode

SYNOPSIS
      use Convert::UU qw(uudecode uuencode);
      $encoded_string = uuencode($string,[$filename],[$mode]);
      ($string,$filename,$mode) = uudecode($string);
      $string = uudecode($string); # in scalar context

DESCRIPTION
    uuencode() takes as the first argument a string that is to be
    uuencoded. Note, that it is the string that is encoded, not a
    filename. Alternatively a filehandle may be passed that must be
    opened for reading. It returns the uuencoded string including
    `begin' and `end'. Second and third argument are optional and
    specify filename and mode. If unspecified these default to
    "uuencode.uu" and 644.

    uudecode() takes a string as argument which will be uudecoded.
    If the argument is a filehandle this handle will be read
    instead. If it is a reference to an ARRAY, the elements are
    treated like lines that form a string. Leading and trailing
    garbage will be ignored. The function returns the uudecoded
    string for the first begin/end pair. In array context it returns
    an array whose first element is the uudecoded string, the second
    is the filename and the third is the mode.

EXPORT
    Both uudecode and uuencode are in @EXPORT_OK.
