=head1 Revision history for Perl module Convert::UU.

=head2 0.30  Mar 10, 1999

Harald Joerg C<E<lt>Harald.Joerg@mch.sni.de$<gt>> sent me a patch to
add binmode to the filehandles that are used, so the whole thing works on
Windows.

Modernized the Makefile.PL to use fixin() instead of writing the
EXE_FILES "by hand".

=head2 0.20  Feb 7, 1997

Further investigation of the warning I "fixed" yesterday. Added tests
for a trailing empty string in the last line of the uuencoded string
and for a zero in the last line of the uudecoded string. Found the bug
in the code that skipped lines starting with a "#". Allowing such
lines fixed a long standing bug.

Thanks to Kurtis D. Rader <krader@sequent.com> who describes that a
uuencoded chunk that consists of nothing but backtick triggers a "Use
of uninitialized variable" warning. Although I'd like to see it as a
bug in perl this version takes precautions to avoid the warning.

=head2 0.05  Nov 25, 1997

Updated to perl5.004 using m//gc instead of s///.

Using binmode() for filehandles to (hopefully) make it work on
Non-UNIX systems (Thanks to Bill Baxter <bill@visix.com> for the
report)

=head2 0.04  Feb 10, 1997

Integrated a patch by leachcj@bp.com that allows array references
being passed to uudecode.
